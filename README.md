# A Simple Arduino Web App

The HttpRequest.h, HttpRequest.cpp, and HttpRequestParser.ino are written by Francisco G. Paletta.  See the header comment in those files for the original text.

To use the HttpRequestParser.ino sketch, place the HttpRequest.h and .cpp files in a folder inside the libraries folder of your Arduino IDE installation.  You may have to specify a server IP Address if you have multiple network.
